;; The following procedure list->tree converts an ordered list to a balanced bianry tree.
;; the helper procedure partial-tree takes as arguments an integer n and list of at least
;; n elements and constructs a balanced tree containing the first n elements of the list.
;; The result returned by partial-tree is a pair (formed with cons) whose car is the
;; constructed tree and whose cdr is the list of elements not included in the tree.
