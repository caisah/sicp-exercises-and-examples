;; Ben Bitdiddle decides to test the queue implementation described above. He types in
;; the procedures to the List interpreter and proceeds to try them out:
 
;;   (define q1 (make-queue))
;;   (insert-queue! q1 'a)
;;   ((a) a)
;;   (insert-queue! q1 'b)
;;   ((a b) b)
;;   (delete-queue! q1)
;;   ((b) b)
;;   (delete-queue! q1)
;;   (() b)

;; "It's all wrong!" he complains. "The interpreter's response shows that the last item is
;; inserted into the queue twice. And when I delete both items, the second b is still there,
;; so the queue isn't empty, even though it's supposed to be." Eva Lu Ator suggests that
;; Ben has misunderstood that is happening. "It's not that the items are going into the queue
;; twice", she explains. "It's just that the standard Lisp printer doesn't know how to make
;; sense of the queue representation. If you want to see the queue printed correctly, you'll
;; have to define your own print procedure for queues." Explain what Eva Lu is talking about.
;; In particular, show why Ben's examples produce the printed results that they do.
;; Define a procedure  print-queue that takes a queue as input an prints the sequence of
;; items in the queue.

(define (print-queue queue)
  (car queue))

(define q1 (make-queue))
