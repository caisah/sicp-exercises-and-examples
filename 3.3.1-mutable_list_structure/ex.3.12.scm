;; The following procedure for appending lists was introduced in Section 2.2.1:

;;   (define (append x y)
;;     (if (null? x)
;;         y
;;         (cons (car x) (append (cdr x) y))))

;; Append forms a new list by successively consing the elements of x onto y. The procedure
;; append! is similar to append but it is a mutator rather than a constructor. It appends
;; the lists by splicing them together, modifying the final pair of x so that its cdr is
;; now y. (It is an error to call append! with an empty x.)

;;   (define (append! x y)
;;     (set-cdr! (last-pair x) y)
;;     x)

;; Here last-pair is a procedure that returns the last pair in its argument:

;; (define (last-pair x)
;;     (if (null? (cdr x))
;;         x
;;         (last-pair (cdr x))))

;; Consider the interaction

;;   (define x (list 'a 'b))
;;   (define y (list 'c 'd))
;;   (define z (append x y))
;;   z
;;   (a b c d)
;;   (cdr x)
;;   <response>
;;   (define w (append! x y))
;;   w
;;   (a b c d)
;;   (cdr x)
;;   <response>

;; What are the missing <reponse>s? 


;; (b)
;; (b c d)
